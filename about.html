        <p>
          Thomas Neuroth is a telecommunications engineer and businessman. Thomas spent many years
          in sales positions in the semiconductor industry before starting his own business, which was a
          fabless DSL Chip vendor, eventually acquired by Analog Devices (ADI).
        </p>
        <p>
          Thomas has been through all the stages of a technology company from start-up and founding,
          through growth to a successful exit. After his company was acquired, he wanted to make use
          of his accumulated skill set to help promising start ups grow into successful businesses, so he became
          a business angel, working to help incubate a number of start-ups.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thomas&#8217; main ambition with these efforts is to use enabling technologies to build value in new
          technologies that provide real solutions to problems. As a seasoned and inspiring salesman,
          negotiator and team builder Thomas jointly founded Infotope with Dr. Bluschke and is the company's
          CEO focusing the group on a solid growth path from concept stage to productization.

          Dr. Andreas Bluschke has an advanced degree in optical data transmission. Over the last 25 years
          Andreas has accumulated a deep knowledge of telecommunications and is a substantial contributor
          of scientific papers, holder of many patents and a technology visionary. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon German reunification, Dr. Bluschke founded Dresden-based Teleconnect, a trusted and well
          respected supplier of research and development services for a number of leading telecommunications
          equipment manufacturers. His goal of driving the development of groundbreaking products that go
          beyond the scope of Teleconnect inspired him to join in the founding of infotope.

          The founding team is complemented by Philipp Rietzsch, MSc (Chief System Architect and networking
          specialist), Stephan Kuhn, MBA (Project Manager) and Dr. Tom Wilson (Head of SW Design).

      <h1>HISTORY</h1>
      <div class="page-text">
        <p>
          Having collaborated over more than fifteen years on various projects, Andreas and Thomas
          met to discuss Teleconnect&#8217;s promising opportunities with a new technology (G.hn, based on ITU
          standard G.9960). After thorough research and a lot of brainstorming and consultation in their
          professional networks, the idea for infotope was born! It turned out, that this standards-based,
          cost-efficient technology leads the way to a convincing solution for residential networking,
          which could be completed by industrial-grade security measures into a whole product,
          serving a broad range of needs and target groups.
