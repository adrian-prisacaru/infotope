        WHAT DO WE OFFER ?

        <p>
          The product consists of hardware components and management software to implement a residential
          network for private and business use. It combines wired and wireless transmission with privacy
          protection and network security into one complete system, underpinning our slogan: "any wire,
          any fiber, any radio". The system relies on and enhances existing infrastructures (power lines etc.)
          and grows with the needs of its users, due to modular design and scalability.
        </p>
        <p>
          This allows all important needs, like network coherency, bandwidth and security, to be covered at
          the same time. These needs result from the continuous increase of Internet traffic and changes in
          user behavior regarding media consumption.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concept of embedded, distributed processors ensures flexibility and future-proofness.
          This also forms the basis for our product, to act as a platform for various service solutions like
          home automation or home entertainment. Together with the security features, personal cloud
          solutions can be built, fulfilling the claim of the digital ecosystem.

        <p>
          Our hardware is based on the ITU standard 9960 aka G.hn ("hn" = home network). It is the newest
          and most versatile data transmission technology for the last section of the Internet, the LAN.
          The aim of this technology is to be an open, interoperable, secure means for wired networking.
          Part of the approach was to ensure interoperability between participating chip vendors (currently five)
          and to avoid the shortcomings of previous transmission standards. This approach, as described by
          the community organization www.homegrid.org, is honored by more and more service providers,
          as they join the club and commit to using this technology in their markets. By choosing this approach,
          we can not only use the built-in properties (multi-wire, quality of service features, encryption,
          highest data rate per wire technology,..) but also add more features to provide USPs beyond the
          standard approach defined by the chip manufacturers.

          The wired network forms the backbone for wireless devices, which reside in the network nodes.
          These can be either various kinds of WiFi (801.11g/n or v) or other services like Z-Wave, Bluetooth or
          whatever is required. Due to the modular and scalable approach, connectivity by all communication
          technologies can be achieved, reaching all networked devices and serving all bandwidth requirements
          at any place with one secure system.

        SECURITY AND PRIVACY
      </h1>
      <div class="page-text">
        <p>
          Our software, based on proven Open Source code, adds a professional security solution on top of the
          built-in protection features of G.hn, constituting the main differentiator to any G.hn implementation on
          the market.
        </p>
        <p>
          By establishing a fine-grained role and rights model, data and traffic in the network can be managed
          and protected in various ways. Trusted and proven security standards are used to prevent intrusion,
          filter unwanted traffic or content, and refuse untrusted connection attempts. These principles allow
          infotope to act as a platform for certified subsystems as required for services like smart metering.
        </p>
        <p>
          The roles and rights model also allows prevention of unwanted connections of devices beyond their
          intended use. A typical example would be a TV set which communicates viewing behavior to an
          external server.
