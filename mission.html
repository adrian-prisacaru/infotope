        VISION
      </h1>
      <div class="page-text">
        <p>
          Being connected is one of the foundations of our digital lifestyle. Being connected in our homes
          still is a challenge, due to the need to cover all connectable users, whether humans or devices.
          Until now, any user oriented service is built on proprietary infrastructure or simply assumes,
          that connectivity and sufficient throughput is available.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is, where we see infotope's destiny: building a seamless networking infrastructure that
          supports all needs and services, both now and in the future. We combine wired and wireless
          transmission media, using the existing copper plant, add fiber where required for higher bandwidth
          and create a wired backbone that supports all kinds of wireless services.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, a powerful network should not leave the user unprotected! We bring professional-grade
          IT security to the home, providing a shelter for all personal data and services within a private cloud.
          This is complemented by simple setup, powerful yet easy-to-handle management features,
          energy efficiency, to provide a superior user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to link all networks in the home, based on a single management and single user interface
          with overall protection - for you to create, manage and protect your digital ecosystem.

        THE SECURITY AND PRIVACY CHALLENGE OF THE IOT
      </h1>
      <div class="page-text">
        <p>
          The Internet of Things is currently a big buzzword, promising a digital wonderland where every
          single device becomes intelligent, aware and alert - that&#8217;s the marketing dream. In reality
          networked gadgets, each operating and controlled independently, often create network
          incompatibilities and security holes due to the way in which they interconnect and network.
          Without some secure &#8220;glue&#8221; to link all of the pieces (and their different networks) together,
          the end user and their data are open to threats unimaginable only 2 or 3 years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore many IoT devices, by offering to store personal data in the cloud, may be used
          as Trojan horses. Therefore, instead of improving and simplifying the user experience, the user
          and their data are exposed globally to threats that the user may never know about. Personal
          profile data is typically harvested via many IoT services to create a marketing database for a system
          supplier&#8217;s benefit - not the customer - and stored somewhere the customer has no knowledge of or
          control over. Infotope protects against this leaking of customer information.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that security must be robust and present in the home for all systems and networks,
          never treated as an afterthought or handled solely by the devices away from user scrutiny!
          The home network is the only place to deal with security in a professional, cost-efficient and thorough
          fashion to truly protect the user and their data. We strongly believe that user behavioral data belongs
          to the individual and should remain under their control, with them deciding on sharing it or not.
          We provide them with this option.
        </p>

        TARGET MARKET
      </h1>
      <div class="page-text">
        <p>
          Our target market are all users of broadband connections (fixed and mobile) with home or office use.
          By saying that we are looking at a potential of more than 150 million users in the EU and more than
          700 million connections worldwide for fixed broadband.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of these customers wish to operate connected equipment or services in their home, small offices
          or other premises &#8211; for a combination of automation, entertainment, comfort or computer access.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides the fundamental need of connectivity and network coverage all over the premises,
          bandwidth needs and hassle-free installation on top of an existing wired infrastructure are highly
          important.
        </p>
        <p>
          We aim to serve private and corporate customers with our unique network solution, which will also
          serve as a platform for various new services.
